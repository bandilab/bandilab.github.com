title: Transactions in the Bandicoot

<p>
One of the most interesting features of the Bandicoot system is its simple
approach for transaction handling. In this blog I would like to show how
intuitive and powerfull the transactions are.
</p>
<p>
Before we move onto the details it's important to note that Bandicoot
implements all ACID<a href="#links">[1]</a> properties. It's important to keep
this in mind when writing applications in the Bandicoot. It'll help you to relax
and trust the system.
</p>
<p>
So, let's start very simple. Look at the following piece of code:
</p>
<pre>
rel Order {
    item: string,
    client: int
}

orders: Order;

fn AddOrder(o: Order)
{
    orders = orders + o;
}
</pre>
<p>
I believe the code is self-explanatory and does not require further comments.
The important bit to understand is how the AddOrder function works.
The function modifies a global variable and if more than one execution is being 
performed at a time it requires a synchronization of the assignment.
Otherwise, we could end up with corrupted value. Note that this is no different
to a general purpose programming language (i.e. Java synchronized blocks 
<a href="#links">[2]</a>).
What is different is the fact that the Bandicoot takes care of this on your
behalf. Every time you are modifying a global variable you can be sure that
there is no-one else doing the same.
</p>
<p>
But the Bandicoot goes even further. The synchronization is always done on the
function level. 
It never happens just around a single assignment. Let's have a look at the
following code:
</p>
<pre>
pending: Order;

fn MovePending()
{
    orders = orders + pending;
    pending = pending - pending;
}

fn MoveOrders()
{
    pending = pending + orders;
    orders = orders - orders;
}
</pre>
<p>
We have introduced another variable, pending orders. We also added functions
which modify the same variables but in a different order. Due to the
synchronization on the function level this is not a problem and the system will
simply execute one function after the other. This also means, there are no 
deadlocks going to happen regardless of how the code is written.
</p>
<p>
There is also another important action happening on the function level; commit
or rollback. Even though you are able to modify a value of a global variable
in the first statement of a function, in reality the new values are not
visible until the function execution is finished. This provides a complete
isolation and no operation can see partial state of variables. If there is an
error during an execution the changes are rolled-back and your variables stay
in a consistent state.
</p>
<p>
This all sounds great, but what about reads? How does it work? Are the
read-only functions synchronized as well? No, if you have read-only functions
they are executed in parallel with writes and other reads. This is implemented
via snapshots in the system. The Bandicoot keeps multiple versions of global
variables. The older, not latest, versions are kept as long as there is someone 
reading them. To be more specific, at a time a function is invoked
the system determines what versions, of all variables used in the functions, will 
be read.
</p>
<p>
Let's now discuss this more in details with using MovePending and GetAll
function as defined below:
</p>
<pre>
fn GetAll(): Order
{
    return orders + pending;
}
</pre>
<p>
If the GetAll and MovePending functions are executed at the same
time, the GetAll function will progress and return the result as of the 
time the function was invoked. Imagine your execution of the GetAll function 
is in progress and it's just finished reading the orders variable. It is about
to read the pending one which in the meanwhile was modified by an execution of the
MovePending. The fact that the MovePending was executed while GetAll is
running does not have any impact on the results. The version of the pending 
variable you are going to see is the previous version consistent with
the version of the orders variable you have just read.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
To sum up, there are four very important features implied from the
way how the Bandicoot implements transactions:
<ul>
    <li>conflicting write functions are synchronized as a whole,
    instead of synchronizing each assignment separately</li>
    <li>changes made in a function are visible only after the whole
    execution</li>
    <li>a function reads consistent state across multiple variables; as of
    the time the function is invoked</li>
    <li>reads of the same variable in a function always return the
    same values</li>
</ul>
