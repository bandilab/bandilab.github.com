title: Performance of the Bandicoot v1

This is a very brief update on the v1 performance. Here are the figures from
exactly the same laptop as in the previous post (and again with the -Os gcc
option):

    $ cd bandicoot
    $ ctl pack
    $ bin/test/perf/relation
       write 1000 tuples in 1ms
        read 1000 tuples in 0ms
       write 10000 tuples in 2ms
        read 10000 tuples in 2ms
       write 100000 tuples in 18ms
        read 100000 tuples in 21ms
       write 1000000 tuples in 175ms
        read 1000000 tuples in 212ms
        join 1000x1000 tuples in 2ms
        join 10000x10000 tuples in 16ms
        join 100000x100000 tuples in 296ms
        join 1000000x1000000 tuples in 4983ms
    semidiff 1000x1000 tuples (res=500 tuples) in 1ms
    semidiff 10000x10000 tuples (res=5000 tuples) in 13ms
    semidiff 100000x100000 tuples (res=50000 tuples) in 263ms
    semidiff 1000000x1000000 tuples (res=500000 tuples) in 4743ms
     project 1000 tuples from 1000 in 1ms
     project 10000 tuples from 10000 in 13ms
     project 100000 tuples from 100000 in 222ms
     project 1000000 tuples from 1000000 in 3821ms
      select 1 tuples from 1000 in 0ms
      select 1 tuples from 10000 in 2ms
      select 1 tuples from 100000 in 15ms
      select 1 tuples from 1000000 in 154ms
       union 1000x1000 tuples (res=1500 tuples) in 1ms
       union 10000x10000 tuples (res=15000 tuples) in 17ms
       union 100000x100000 tuples (res=150000 tuples) in 338ms
       union 1000000x1000000 tuples (res=1500000 tuples) in 5835ms
      extend 1000 tuples in 0ms
      extend 10000 tuples in 4ms
      extend 100000 tuples in 43ms
      extend 1000000 tuples in 502ms
         sum 1000x1000 tuples in 1ms
         sum 10000x10000 tuples in 23ms
         sum 100000x100000 tuples in 362ms
         sum 1000000x1000000 tuples in 5710ms
          eq 1000x1000 tuples in 0ms
          eq 10000x10000 tuples in 14ms
          eq 100000x100000 tuples in 247ms
          eq 1000000x1000000 tuples in 4551ms

The test cases also got extended a little bit, and finally the Bandicoot grew
up from 10000 tuples per argument ;-) Of course there are still many things
which could be improved further, but it is a big step forward from where we
were before. Here are the new formulas (#n stands for the number of tuples in
the relation body):

<table>
    <thead>
        <th>Operator</th>
        <th>Sample Expression</th>
        <th>Complexity(*)</th>
    </thead>
    <tr>
        <td>join</td>
        <td>m * n</td>
        <td>#m log #m + #n log #m</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>minus (semidiff)</td>
        <td>m - n</td>
        <td>#n log #n + #m log #n</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>union</td>
        <td>m + n</td>
        <td>#n log #n + #m log #n + #m</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>select</td>
        <td>n select(x &lt; 0)</td>
        <td>#n</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>extend</td>
        <td>n extend(x = 1)</td>
        <td>#n</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>project</td>
        <td>n project(x, y)</td>
        <td>2 * #n log #n</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>summary</td>
        <td>(m, n) summary(x = max(y, 0))</td>
        <td>#m log #m + #n log #m</td>
    </tr>
</table>

`(*)` I tried to keep the formulas closer to the actual execution effort and
hence I do not use the asymptotic notation here.
